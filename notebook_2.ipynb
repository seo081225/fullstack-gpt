      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 cup of rice\n",
      "- 1 cup of water\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of nuruk (fermentation starter)\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of yeast\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for at least 1 hour.\n",
      "2. Drain the rice and steam it until fully cooked.\n",
      "3. Let the rice cool down to room temperature.\n",
      "4. In a large bowl, mix the nuruk and yeast with the cooked rice.\n",
      "5. Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it ferment for 3-4 days in a warm place.\n",
      "6. After fermentation, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth to remove any solids.\n",
      "7. Transfer the liquid to a clean container and let it sit for another 1-2 days to allow the flavors to develop.\n",
      "8. Serve the homemade soju chilled and enjoy responsibly. Ingredients:\n",
      "- 4 cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 packet active dry yeast\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups warm water\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.\n",
      "2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.\n",
      "3. Mix everything together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.\n",
      "4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.\n",
      "5. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place the loaf in a greased loaf pan, cover, and let it rise for another 30 minutes.\n",
      "6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for about 30-35 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
      "7. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving. Enjoy your freshly baked bread! \n",
